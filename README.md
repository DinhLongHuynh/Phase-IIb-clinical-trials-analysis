# Phase-IIb-clinical-trials-analysis
This project is dedicated to a comprehensive examination of the pharmacokinetic variables within both the run-in period study and the phase IIb study of BPI889. BPI889, a promising follow-up compound to indinavir, is currently in development as a treatment for HIV/AIDS.

During the run-in period, the analysis places a distinct focus on discerning the variations between the HIV and HIV+TB groups. Additionally, attention is directed toward assessing the change in CD4 count over time in the absence of any treatment.

Transitioning to the phase IIb period, the analysis delves into the intricate pharmacokinetics of the drug, encompassing crucial parameters such as half-life, Cmax, tmax, and CL. Furthermore, the project scrutinizes variations across different types of mutations and distinguishes between groups with high and low total body water.

This meticulous exploration aims to contribute valuable insights into the efficacy and safety profile of BPI889, paving the way for informed decisions in the ongoing development of this potential HIV/AIDS treatment. The project's findings are anticipated to significantly enhance our understanding of the compound's pharmacological characteristics and guide future clinical strategies.
